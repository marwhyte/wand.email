      Policy and shall Process your Personal Information only if We have a legal
      basis to. We may use your Personal Information in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ol>

      notifications with information, news and offers on Our Services.

      the information they collect and use. Limiting the use of your Personal
      Information in this way will not remove the advertising, but it will make
      it less relevant to your interests and activities on Our Site.
    </p>
